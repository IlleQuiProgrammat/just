# Just

*Just* is an anonymous, end-to-end encrypted reporting platform allowing you to report issues with
confidence.

This was created in response to seeing the multitude of people posting harrowing stories to
*Everyone's Invited*, but also recognising that schools couldn't take action. I therefore wanted
to make a platform on which people would be happy sharing their stories whilst adding an element
which allowed schools to support their students by providing a way to follow up on reports and
provide other actionable information to schools.
